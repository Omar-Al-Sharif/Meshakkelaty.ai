## Overview
Welcome to مِشَكِّلاتي.ai ... An innovative Arabic text diacritization (Tashkeel) engine developed using advanced neural and statistical techniques. This project aims to accurately predict and add diacritics to Arabic text, enhancing readability and understanding. 
The مِشَكِّلاتي.ai model achieved [first-place on Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/cufe-cmp-credit-nlp-fall-2023/leaderboard), showcasing its exceptional performance 🥇

## Dual- Model Architecture
The مِشَكِّلاتي.ai diacritization system employs a dual-model architecture that consists of:
  1. Neural Bidirectional Long Short-Term Memory (BiLSTM) model that captures sequential dependencies and context information within the Arabic text
  2. Statistical Post-Processing model that operates on the output generated by the neural model to further refines the diacritization results

## Usage
To use مِشَكِّلاتي.ai, follow these steps:
1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Install the necessary dependencies.
3. Run the `predict.py` script to diacritize Arabic text.
